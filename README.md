# Project title - Token creation
This Solidity program is a  program that demonstrates the basic data structures involved in the language and its implementation.
## Description
This project is a simple contract written in solidity to create a token with its necessary details. Few functions are implemented to showcase different transactions like minting and burning of the tokens by a user with a unique address. Here for simplicity we take two functions Mint and Burn to add and subtract the balance tokens from the user respectfully.
## Data Structures used-
-Mapping
## Funtions created-
-Mint : It adds the input value to the balance of the tokens that the sender currently holds and also it adds it to the total supply also.  
-Burn : It first checks if the value to be burned is less than or equal to the balance of the sender. If yes, the value is deducted from the balance of the sender and also from the total supply.
